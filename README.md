# color_seed_demo
 This script produces a deterministic color field
 That is, it will seed a random.Random instance with a fixed value, and produce a series of 24 bit RGB colored ansi blocks on the terminal, demonstrating the deterministic nature (if so configured/desired) of pseudo random number generators.  This visualization can greatly aid in the understand of procedural generation methods.
